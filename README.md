# Pytorch_Solutions
Solutions to Pytorch Challenge on the MNIST Dataset and Face Detection achieved accuracy > 97 for MNIST dataset

The solutions are implemented in Jupyter notebooks with complete visualization and intiution.

Contains solution codes all implemented in Pytorch:

1) MNIST Dataset using different types of NN. Highest accuracy achieved using CNN.

2) Face and Gender detection still being developed using CNN in Pytorch
